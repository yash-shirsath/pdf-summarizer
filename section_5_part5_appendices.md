## PART V: THE RATE FOR A CONTINUOUS SOURCE

### Section 27: Fidelity Evaluation Functions

#### The Challenge of Continuous Sources

Unlike discrete sources, continuous sources present unique challenges:
- A continuously variable quantity can assume infinite values
- Exact specification requires infinite binary digits
- Exact transmission requires infinite channel capacity
- Real channels have finite capacity due to noise

#### Practical Approach: Fidelity-Based Transmission

Shannon recognized that exact transmission is neither necessary nor practical. Instead, the focus shifts to:
- Transmission within acceptable tolerance levels
- Defining rates based on fidelity requirements
- Higher fidelity requirements → higher transmission rates

#### Mathematical Formulation of Fidelity

**Message Space Representation:**
- Messages of duration T seconds
- Source described by probability density P(x)
- Communication system described by conditional probability P_x(y)
- Complete system characterized by joint probability P(x,y)

**Fidelity Criterion Requirements:**
Any fidelity evaluation must provide a simple ordering of systems, allowing comparison between systems P₁(x,y) and P₂(x,y).

**General Form of Evaluation Functions:**
Under ergodic assumptions and reasonable evaluation criteria, any fidelity function can be expressed as:

```
v(P(x,y)) = ∬ P(x,y)ρ(x,y) dx dy
```

Where ρ(x,y) represents a "distance" function measuring the undesirability of receiving y when x is transmitted.

#### Examples of Evaluation Functions

**1. R.M.S. (Root Mean Square) Criterion:**
```
ρ(x,y) = (1/T) ∫₀ᵀ [x(t) - y(t)]² dt
```

**2. Frequency-Weighted R.M.S. Criterion:**
```
ρ(x,y) = (1/T) ∫₀ᵀ f(t)² dt
```
where f(t) = ∫₋∞^∞ e(τ)k(t-τ) dτ and e(t) = x(t) - y(t)

**3. Absolute Error Criterion:**
```
ρ(x,y) = (1/T) ∫₀ᵀ |x(t) - y(t)| dt
```

**4. Perceptual Criteria:**
Based on human auditory or visual perception, such as intelligibility for speech transmission.

**5. Discrete Case Specialization:**
Number of differing symbols divided by total symbols.

### Section 28: The Rate for a Source Relative to a Fidelity Evaluation

#### Definition of Rate for Continuous Sources

Given:
- Source probability density P(x)
- Fidelity evaluation determined by distance function ρ(x,y)
- Quality measure: v = ∬ ρ(x,y) P(x,y) dx dy
- Information rate: R = ∬ P(x,y) log[P(x,y)/(P(x)P(y))] dx dy

**Rate Definition:**
The rate R₁ for quality v₁ is defined as:

```
R₁ = Min[P_x(y)] ∬ P(x,y) log[P(x,y)/(P(x)P(y))] dx dy
```

subject to the constraint:
```
v₁ = ∬ P(x,y) ρ(x,y) dx dy
```

#### Fundamental Theorem for Continuous Sources

**Theorem 21:** If a source has rate R₁ for valuation v₁, then:
- **Achievability:** It is possible to encode and transmit over a channel of capacity C with fidelity approaching v₁ if R₁ ≤ C
- **Converse:** This is impossible if R₁ > C

**Proof Strategy:**
1. Discretize the (x,y) space into small cells
2. Choose high-probability y points: 2^(R₁+ε)T members
3. Each chosen point connects to a set of x's via high-probability lines
4. Transmit binary numbers corresponding to chosen points
5. Reconstruct corresponding y at receiver

**Key Insight:** The noise in recovered messages comes from quantization at the transmitter, not channel noise (analogous to PCM quantization noise).

### Section 29: The Calculation of Rates

#### Analogy to Channel Capacity

**Rate Calculation:**
```
R = Min[P_x(y)] ∬ P(x,y) log[P(x,y)/(P(x)P(y))] dx dy
```
with P(x) and fidelity constraint fixed.

**Channel Capacity:**
```
C = Max[P(x)] ∬ P(x,y) log[P(x,y)/(P(x)P(y))] dx dy
```
with P_x(y) and power constraints fixed.

#### Variational Solution

Using Lagrange multipliers, the optimal conditional probability is:
```
P_y(x) = B(x)e^(-λρ(x,y))
```

where λ determines required fidelity and B(x) satisfies normalization:
```
∫ B(x)e^(-λρ(x,y)) dx = 1
```

**Special Case - Translation-Invariant Distance:**
When ρ(x,y) = ρ(x-y), then B(x) = α (constant):
```
P_y(x) = αe^(-λρ(x-y))
```

#### Specific Results for White Noise Sources

**Theorem 22:** For white noise source with power Q and bandwidth W₁, using R.M.S. fidelity criterion:
```
R = W₁ log(Q/N)
```
where N is the allowed mean square error.

**Derivation:**
- R = H(x) - Max H_y(x)
- Maximum H_y(x) occurs when y-x is white noise
- H_y(x) = W₁ log(2πeN)
- H(x) = W₁ log(2πeQ)
- Therefore: R = W₁ log(Q/N)

**Theorem 23:** For any source with bandwidth W₁:
```
W₁ log(Q₁/N) ≤ R ≤ W₁ log(Q/N)
```
where Q₁ is entropy power, Q is average power, N is mean square error.

## APPENDIX 2: DERIVATION OF H = -∑ pᵢ log pᵢ

### Fundamental Assumptions

Shannon's entropy function H must satisfy three key properties:

1. **Continuity:** H should be continuous in the probabilities pᵢ
2. **Monotonicity:** H(1/n, 1/n, ..., 1/n) should increase with n
3. **Decomposition:** Composite choices should yield consistent entropy values

### Mathematical Derivation

**Step 1: Equal Probability Case**
Let A(n) = H(1/n, 1/n, ..., 1/n)

From the decomposition property:
```
A(sm) = A(s) + A(m)
```

**Step 2: Functional Equation**
This leads to the functional equation characteristic of logarithmic functions:
```
A(n) = K log n
```

**Step 3: General Case**
For arbitrary probabilities pᵢ = nᵢ/∑nᵢ, using the decomposition principle and taking limits:

```
H(p₁, p₂, ..., pₙ) = -K ∑ pᵢ log pᵢ
```

**Step 4: Incommensurable Probabilities**
For irrational probabilities, the result follows by continuity through rational approximations.

**Choice of K:** The coefficient K determines the unit of measurement. K = 1 gives entropy in natural units, K = 1/ln(2) gives entropy in bits.

## APPENDIX 3: THEOREMS ON ERGODIC SOURCES

### Ergodic Property and Large Numbers

For ergodic sources (where any state can reach any other state with positive probability):

**Path Frequency:** In a sequence of length N, path pᵢⱼ is traversed approximately PᵢpᵢⱼN times.

**Convergence:** For large N, actual frequencies converge to expected values with high probability.

### Key Results

**Theorem 3 (AEP - Asymptotic Equipartition Property):**
For any ε > 0 and δ > 0, sequences of length N > N₀ fall into two classes:
1. **High probability set:** About 2^(HN) sequences, each with probability ≈ 2^(-HN)
2. **Low probability set:** Remaining sequences with negligible total probability

**Convergence of Entropy Estimates:**
```
Fₙ = -∑ p(BᵢΒⱼ) log p(Bⱼ|Bᵢ)  (conditional entropy)
Gₙ = (1/N)H(B₁B₂...Bₙ)        (entropy per symbol of N-blocks)
```

Properties:
- Fₙ ≤ Gₙ (conditional entropy ≤ block entropy per symbol)
- Both converge to H: lim[N→∞] Fₙ = lim[N→∞] Gₙ = H
- Gₙ is monotonically decreasing
- Fₙ provides better approximation to H

### Practical Implications

**Language Redundancy:** The redundancy of English (≈ 50%) means half of written text is determined by linguistic structure, half chosen freely.

**Approximation Quality:** Fₙ represents the entropy of the N-th order approximation to the source.

## APPENDIX 4: MAXIMIZING THE RATE FOR A SYSTEM OF CONSTRAINTS

### Problem Setup

Given constraints representable by a linear graph with:
- States i, j with transition probabilities pᵢⱼ^(s)
- Symbol lengths ℓᵢⱼ^(s)
- State probabilities Pᵢ

**Objective:** Maximize the rate:
```
R = -∑ PᵢpᵢⱼΒ(s) log pᵢⱼ^(s) / ∑ PᵢpᵢⱼΒ(s) ℓᵢⱼ^(s)
```

### Solution Method

**Lagrangian Approach:**
Maximize U with constraints ∑Pᵢ = 1, ∑ⱼpᵢⱼ = 1, and steady-state conditions.

**Optimal Distribution:**
```
pᵢⱼ = (BⱼC^(-ℓᵢⱼ)) / (∑ₛ BₛC^(-ℓᵢₛ))
```

where:
- C is the channel capacity
- Bᵢ satisfies: Bᵢ = ∑ⱼ BⱼC^(-ℓᵢⱼ)

**State Probabilities:**
```
Pᵢ = Bᵢγᵢ
```
where γᵢ satisfies: ∑ᵢ γᵢC^(-ℓᵢⱼ) = γⱼ

### Key Result

The maximum achievable rate equals the channel capacity C, justifying that properly chosen probability distributions can achieve the theoretical maximum.

## APPENDIX 5: INVARIANCE PROPERTIES

### Stationary and Ergodic Properties Under Transformations

**Invariant Transformation:** An operation T is invariant under time translation if:
```
g_α(t+t₁) = Tf_α(t+t₁)
```
for all functions f_α(t) and all time shifts t₁.

### Preservation Theorems

**Stationarity Preservation:** If T is invariant and the input ensemble is stationary, then the output ensemble is stationary.

**Ergodicity Preservation:** If T is invariant and the input ensemble is ergodic, then the output ensemble is ergodic.

### Proof Strategy

**For Stationarity:**
1. Show that probability measures are preserved under translation
2. Use invariance property: H^λS₁ = H^λTS₂ = TH^λS₂
3. Demonstrate m[H^λS₁] = m[S₁] through measure preservation

**For Ergodicity:**
1. Consider invariant sets under time translation
2. Show that non-trivial invariant sets lead to contradiction
3. Use the property that m[H^λS₂] = m[S₁] implies H^λS₂ = S₂

## APPENDIX 6: ENTROPY POWER INEQUALITIES

### The Entropy Power Inequality

**Theorem 15:** For two ensembles with average powers N₁ and N₂ and entropy powers N̄₁ and N̄₂, the entropy power N̄₃ of their sum satisfies:
```
(N̄₁)^(1/2) + (N̄₂)^(1/2) ≤ (N̄₃)^(1/2) ≤ (N₁ + N₂)^(1/2)
```

### Upper Bound Proof

The upper bound follows from the maximum entropy principle:
- Maximum entropy for fixed power occurs with white noise
- White noise of power N₁ + N₂ has entropy power N₁ + N₂

### Lower Bound Derivation

**Optimization Problem:** Minimize entropy H₃ of convolution r(xᵢ) = ∫ p(yᵢ)q(xᵢ - yᵢ)dyᵢ subject to fixed H₁ and H₂.

**Variational Method:**
```
U = -∫[r(x)log r(x) + λp(x)log p(x) + μq(x)log q(x)]dx
```

**Optimality Conditions:**
```
∫ q(xᵢ - sᵢ)log r(xᵢ)dxᵢ = -λlog p(sᵢ)
∫ p(xᵢ - sᵢ)log r(xᵢ)dxᵢ = -μlog q(sᵢ)
```

**Gaussian Case:** When p and q are Gaussian with covariance matrices having inverses aᵢⱼ and bᵢⱼ:
- The convolution r is Gaussian with c⁻¹ᵢⱼ = aᵢⱼ + bᵢⱼ
- Minimum occurs when aᵢⱼ = Kbᵢⱼ (proportional covariances)
- This yields the lower bound (N̄₁)^(1/2) + (N̄₂)^(1/2) ≤ (N̄₃)^(1/2)

## APPENDIX 7: GENERAL FORMULATION AND MEASURE-THEORETIC APPROACH

### Abstract Measure-Theoretic Framework

**Probability Measure Space:** Elements are ordered pairs (x,y) representing transmitted and received signals.

**Strip Notation:**
- Strip over S₁: set of points whose x belongs to subset S₁
- Strip over S₂: set of points whose y belongs to subset S₂

### Rate Definition via Subdivision

**Discrete Approximation:**
Divide x and y into measurable subsets Xᵢ and Yᵢ:
```
R₁ = (1/T) ∑ᵢ P(Xᵢ,Yᵢ) log[P(Xᵢ,Yᵢ)/(P(Xᵢ)P(Yᵢ))]
```

**Monotonicity Property:** Further subdivision never decreases R₁.

**Proof:** When X₁ is subdivided into X₁' + X₁'', the contribution changes from:
```
(d+e)log[(d+e)/(a(b+c))] to d log(d/(ab)) + e log(e/(ac))
```

This satisfies:
```
[(d+e)/(b+c)]^(d+e) ≤ (d^d e^e)/(b^d c^e)
```
ensuring the sum increases.

### Continuous Limit

**General Definition:**
```
R = (1/T) ∬ P(x,y) log[P(x,y)/(P(x)P(y))] dx dy
```

**Properties:**
1. **Coordinate Independence:** R is invariant under one-to-one transformations
2. **Information Processing:** Any operation on received signal cannot increase R
3. **Generality:** Includes discrete, continuous, and mixed cases

### Dimension Rate Concept

**Definition:** The dimension rate λ for an ensemble f_α(t) is:
```
λ = lim[δ→0] lim[ε→0] lim[T→∞] log N(ε,δ,T)/(T log ε⁻¹)
```

where N(ε,δ,T) is the minimum number of elements needed to cover the ensemble within distance ε, excluding a set of measure δ.

**Significance:** Generalizes intuitive notions of dimensionality to stochastic processes (e.g., 2W for band-limited processes).
