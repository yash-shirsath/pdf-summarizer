# Section 5: Analysis Methods, References, and Supplementary Information

## Overview

This section provides a comprehensive overview of the computational methods, technical implementations, and supplementary materials used in the single-cell atlas of human DNA methylation and 3D genome structure. The study employed novel and improved analytical approaches to handle the large-scale, multi-modal dataset comprising 86,689 cells across 16 human tissues.

## Cell Embedding and Clustering Approaches

### Novel 5kb Bin-Based Clustering Method

The study developed an improved method for clustering single-cell methylation data using **5kb genomic bins** as features, which outperformed traditional 100kb-bin-based methods, particularly for brain cells. This approach addressed the challenge of identifying cell types in tissues where fewer long and specific methylation features were observed compared to neuronal tissues.

**Key Features:**
- Universal adaptability across different tissue types
- Enhanced sensitivity for cell type identification
- Improved resolution for distinguishing cellular subtypes
- Overcame limitations of promoter-focused or enhancer-dependent methods

### Anchor-Based Integration Method

To address batch effects across donors and tissues, the researchers implemented:
- **Anchor-based method** for data integration between donors
- **Geometric distance-based filtering** to refine anchors
- Comparison of two embedding strategies:
  - Direct concatenation of mCG and 3C embeddings
  - Weighted nearest neighbor (WNN) framework

The direct concatenation approach was selected as it better preserved cluster structures when modalities showed different separation patterns.

## Quality Control and Data Processing

### Exclusion List Generation

A critical quality control measure involved creating an **exclusion list for 3D genome contacts** to remove artifactual contacts:
- Removed misalignments over repeat regions due to 3-base pair genome alignment
- Filtered regions with unusually high signals overlapping with highly repeated regions
- Applied consistent filtering across different donors and cell types
- Used median signal >1 as selection criterion for exclusion

### Contact Distance Thresholds

The study established a **2.5kb cutoff** for classifying read pairs as chromatin contacts by:
- Comparing snmC-seq3 (continuous DNA molecules) with snm3C-seq data
- Analyzing distance-dependent decay patterns
- Distinguishing true chromatin contacts from artifacts

### Doublet Removal and Quality Control

Comprehensive quality control procedures included:
- Rigorous doublet identification and removal
- Validation of clustering quality through cross-donor comparisons
- Integration with existing datasets (ENTEx project, snATAC-seq data)

## Comparative Analysis Methods

### Cross-Modal Validation

The study employed multiple validation strategies:

**Correlation Analysis:**
- Strongest correlations observed between identical cell types across donors
- Lower correlations between different subtypes/major types
- Validation against previous sorted cell populations and bulk tissues

**Adjusted Rand Index (ARI):**
- Quantified consistency between DNA methylation and chromatin contact clusters
- Revealed variable agreement across different lineages
- Identified cases where modalities show distinct clustering patterns

### Integration with External Datasets

**Comparison with Historical Data:**
- Schultz et al. 2015 methylation data
- ENTEx collaborative project data
- GTEx consortium data
- Previous snATAC-seq studies

**Data Format Conversions:**
- Genome coordinate mapping from hg19 to hg38 using LiftOver
- ALLC format processing and beta format conversions
- Generation of sample-by-1kb genomic bin matrices

## ATAC-seq Analysis Procedures

### Peak-DMR Overlap Analysis

The study performed comprehensive comparisons between DNA methylation and chromatin accessibility:

**Overlap Statistics:**
- 48% of ATAC-seq peaks overlapped with DMRs within major cell types
- 33% of DMRs overlapped with ATAC-seq peaks within major cell types
- 91.9% of ATAC-seq peaks overlapped DMRs across all tissues
- 61.9% of DMRs overlapped ATAC-seq peaks globally

**Methylation Depletion Analysis:**
- Systematic depletion of both mCG and mCH at ATAC-seq peaks
- Stronger depletion in cell types where peaks were originally called
- Identification of small fraction of hyper-methylated peaks

### Transcription Factor Motif Analysis

**Multiple Analytical Approaches:**
1. **PycisTarget** - Used for multi-group comparisons with comprehensive motif collections
2. **Homer** - Applied for loop-specific transcription factor inference
3. **SCENIC+ motif collection** - Employed for broad motif enrichment analysis

**Technical Parameters:**
- Normalized enrichment score (NES) >3 as cutoff for enriched motifs
- Fixed region size of Â±500 bp from region centers
- Separate analyses for peak DMRs vs. non-peak DMRs

## Specialized Analyses

### Repeat-Based Clustering

The study examined cell-type specificity of DNA methylation across different repeat element categories:

**Repeat Element Types Analyzed:**
- **DNA transposons** - Strong cell type separation capability
- **LINE** (Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements) - Effective for clustering
- **LTR** (Long Terminal Repeats) - Good discrimination power
- **SINE** (Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements) - Lower performance due to coverage limitations
- **Satellite DNA** - Weaker specificity for cell clustering
- **Retroposons** - Limited accuracy due to size constraints

### Chromatin Compartments Analysis

**A/B Compartment Characterization:**
- Analysis of compartment interactions as function of genomic distance
- Comparison between domain-dominant (neuronal) vs. compartment-dominant (hematopoietic) lineages
- Calculation of compartment scores across lineages

**Methylation Compartment Framework:**
- Division of genome into four compartments based on mCG patterns
- Correlation with traditional A/B compartments
- Exception noted in neural lineages

### Chromatin Domains and Loops

**Contact Decay Analysis:**
- Identification of two prominent enrichment peaks (100kb-1Mb and >10Mb)
- Classification of lineages as "domain dominant" vs. "compartment dominant"
- Analysis of Topologically Associating Domains (TADs)

**Loop Analysis:**
- Variable loop patterns across cell types
- Integration with DMR analysis
- Motif enrichment at loop anchors

## Key Technical Implementations
