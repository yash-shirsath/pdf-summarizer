## Key Research Objectives

### Primary Goals
The study aims to comprehensively profile **3D genome structure** and **DNA methylation** patterns across human cell types using single-cell resolution technology. The research addresses a critical gap in understanding how these epigenomic features vary across the human body.

### Specific Objectives
1. **Multi-omic profiling** of 86,689 single nuclei across 16 human tissues
2. **Cell type identification** and classification into major types and subtypes
3. **Characterization of DNA methylation** patterns including both CG and non-CG methylation
4. **Analysis of 3D chromatin structure** at unprecedented cellular resolution
5. **Integration of epigenomic features** to understand their relationship in maintaining cell identity

## Major Findings from Introduction

### Technology and Scale
- Used **single-nucleus methyl-3C (snm3C-seq)** technology to simultaneously profile DNA methylation and 3D genome architecture
- Generated data from **16 human tissues** with **86,689 high-quality cells**
- Obtained **195 billion non-clonal methylation reads** and **18 billion long-range chromatin contacts**
- Identified **35 major cell types** and **206 cellular subtypes**

### Key Discoveries
1. **Extensive methylation variability:** Found widespread changes in both CG and non-CG methylation across almost all cell types
2. **Cell type discrepancies:** Revealed extensive discrepancies between cell types delineated by DNA methylation versus genome structure
3. **Comprehensive reference:** Created the first single-cell atlas of DNA methylation and 3D genome architecture across human tissues
4. **Novel computational methods:** Developed improved analytical approaches to handle the complexity of multi-modal single-cell data

### Methodological Innovations
- Developed exclusion lists for 3D genome contacts to remove artifactual contacts
- Introduced methods to cluster cells using DNA methylation across 5kb genomic bins
- Implemented anchor-based integration methods for data across donors
- Created an interactive cell browser for data exploration (https://humancellepigenomeatlas.arcinstitute.org)

## Research Significance and Novelty

### Scientific Impact
1. **First comprehensive atlas:** This represents the first single-cell body map of human DNA methylation and 3D genome architecture
2. **Resolution breakthrough:** Achieves unprecedented cellular resolution for studying chromatin structure across human tissues
3. **Multi-modal integration:** Combines two critical epigenomic features in single cells, revealing their complex relationship
4. **Clinical relevance:** Provides extensive reference for exploring gene regulation in human health and disease

### Novel Insights
1. **Cell identity mechanisms:** Shows that distinct epigenomic features may have varying roles in maintaining cell identity across different lineages
2. **Regulatory diversity:** Demonstrates extensive diversity in DNA methylation and chromatin structure across human cell types
3. **Technology advancement:** Addresses analytical challenges in processing large-scale multi-modal single-cell data
4. **Biological understanding:** Expands understanding of how different chromatin regulatory mechanisms cooperate to establish cellular identities

### Comparison to Previous Work
The study significantly advances beyond previous efforts that:
- Focused on bulk tissues for DNA methylation or 3D genome profiling
- Used cell sorting methods with limited resolution for subpopulations
- Studied these epigenomic features in isolation
- Were limited to specific tissues or cultured cell lines

This comprehensive atlas provides a valuable resource for the scientific community to study cell-type-resolved patterns of DNA methylation and 3D chromatin conformation across diverse human tissues and cell types.
